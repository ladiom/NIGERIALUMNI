# Netlify Email Status - Nigeria Alumni Network

## ✅ Current Status: FUNCTIONAL BUT NOT CONFIGURED

### What's Working:
- ✅ Netlify function is deployed and accessible
- ✅ CORS is properly configured
- ✅ Function accepts POST requests
- ✅ Email templates are being processed
- ✅ Function returns success responses

### What's Not Working:
- ❌ Office 365 SMTP credentials are not configured
- ❌ Emails are in "fallback mode" (not actually sent)
- ❌ Real email delivery is not happening

## 🔧 Next Steps to Fix:

### 1. Configure Office 365 Credentials in Netlify
Go to your Netlify dashboard and add these environment variables:

```
OFFICE365_EMAIL=your-email@yourdomain.com
OFFICE365_PASSWORD=your-app-password
```

### 2. Get Office 365 App Password
1. Sign in to Office 365
2. Go to Security settings
3. Enable 2FA if not already enabled
4. Create an App Password for "Nigeria Alumni Network SMTP"
5. Use this app password (NOT your regular password)

### 3. Test Again
Once credentials are set, the function will switch from fallback mode to real email sending.

## 📧 Current Behavior:
- Function returns: `"Email queued (Office 365 not configured)"`
- Status: `"success": true` (but fallback mode)
- MessageId: `"fallback-{timestamp}"`

## 🎯 Expected Behavior After Fix:
- Function returns: `"Email sent successfully"`
- Status: `"success": true` (real sending)
- MessageId: `"actual-smtp-message-id"`

## 📝 Files Involved:
- `netlify/functions/send-email.js` - The Netlify function
- `src/services/emailService.js` - Frontend email service
- `netlify.toml` - Netlify configuration

## 🚀 Quick Test Command:
```bash
node --input-type=module -e "import('./test_netlify_email.js').then(m => m.runTests())"
```

**Status**: Ready for Office 365 configuration
**Priority**: High - needed for real email functionality
